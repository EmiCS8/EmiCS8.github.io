        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economic Studiesüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Emiliano Limas is an economics student at the University of California, Riverside. He is an aspiring entrepreneur and is interested in owning multiple businesses. He enjoys traveling the world and getting to know new cultures and people but has an even keener interest in Japanese culture. As a student, he is responsible, attentive, and compassionate about learning new things every day, he values passion, gratitude, respect, and most importantly, integrity. Emiliano‚Äôs integrity is a big part of who he is, he is devoted to following his moral compass, and always aims at doing things the right way, even if it means doing it the hardest way. Emiliano tries to throw himself into competitive environments to learn from others and gain an advantage without breaking his moral compass. He always listens and aims to make logical decisions, maintains a cool-headed attitude when faced with complications, and avoids rash decisions. <br><br>
          
          <br>Whenever Emiliano is not studying, or traveling the world, he dedicates his time to practicing tennis at the ‚ÄúTennis at UCR‚Äù club at the University of California, Riverside. As a beginner, he enjoys playing and learning with others. And whenever he isn‚Äôt playing tennis, Emiliano dedicates himself to pursuing video games professionally, video games and Esports play a big role in Emiliano‚Äôs life and personality. His natural competitive nature drove him to pursue a career as an Esports athlete. He is really passionate about Esports and puts his heart and soul into it. 
          
          <br>In his free time, he also enjoys listening to music, watching movies, or hanging out with friends, he considers time off an important part of his daily routine, as it allows him to settle down in between high-stress activities such as homework, competitive gaming, or exercising.

        <br> 

        Emiliano was born in the United States but was raised in Mexico, he deeply loves Mexican food and culture. However, he has a love-hate relationship with Mexico, and not always has it been easy, the lack of security has resulted in Emiliano experiencing multiple close calls with house robbers among other indescribable crimes. It hasn‚Äôt been a rough upbringing for him, but neither has it been easy and peaceful. No matter how hard life gets, Emiliano always pushes through and faces situations head-on. Part of what makes him so ambitious is his drive to support his family and himself, as 1st generation college student, Emiliano has a lot on his shoulders, but he is determined and motivated to push ahead in order to help and inspire his family back in Mexico. Emiliano constantly pursues opportunities that enable him to talk to people who are familiar with the line of work he pursues, mentors sometimes take him under his wing for a couple of wings and he talks on the phone with them for hours every week, often just listening and taking notes, this way he knows what to expect in the future. As a result, Emiliano has slowly grown his networking circle and has already learned about interesting work offers after college.
